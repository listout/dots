.dots

These are my very basic dots. There are little to no modifications for
everything other than my text editor, i.e. Vim/Neovim and zsh. Apart from that
most configurations are the defaults.

I've zsh is my shell of choice and most of the configurations are copied from
archwiki and some other internet resources. I don't use any form of
pluing/framework.  The only external plugin I use for zsh is the theme (pure by
sindresorhus).

If anyone comes across this repository, they're free to copy/use whatever they
find suitable.
